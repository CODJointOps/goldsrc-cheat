*Note:* If =dz_autoshoot= is enabled, and =dz_aimbot= is enabled, it will stop
attacking if there is no visible target.

#+begin_quote
*Note:* Chams color can be changed from the =h_glColor4f()= function inside
[[https://git.deadzone.lol/Wizzard/goldsource-cheat/src/branch/main/src/hooks.c][src/hooks.c]]. Since this cheat is not hard to compile, I rather have less
console variables than more customization at runtime.

*Note:* Bullet tracer color, width and time can be changed at the bottom of the
=bullet_tracers()= function inside [[https://git.deadzone.lol/Wizzard/goldsource-cheat/src/branch/main/src/features/misc.c][src/features/misc.c]]. See previous chams note.

* Building
#+begin_src console
$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://git.deadzone.lol/Wizzard/goldsource-cheat

$ make

Note that you will need to clone with =--recurse-submodules= for the sdk. If you
have already cloned it, you can just:

#+begin_src console
$ cd goldsource-cheat
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
#+end_src

* Injecting
Uses the [[https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/gdb/index.html][gdb]] debugger for injecting the library.

#+begin_src console
$ ./injector.sh
[sudo] password for username:

...

goldsource-cheat loaded!
